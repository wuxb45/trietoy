# first, download a sample file at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words.txt
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words.txt

$ make
$ ./replay.out words.txt <workload1

The parameter is the sample file. Each line in the sample file is a key.
The index starts from 0 so the first key in the index will be referred as key[0]

The "<workload1" uses the commands in workload1 as the input at stdin.
Without this "<",  you can input your commands at the terminal.

The format of the commands is as such:
seqset <first> <last>
seqget <first> <last>
seqdel <first> <last>
rndset <first> <last>
rndget <first> <last>
rnddel <first> <last>

Look at workload1 for examples.
